# ParkingGarageSystem


We be able to add most of the requirements, which were: UML Diagrams (Use case diagram, class diagram); A burndown chart; GitHub usage; Implementation using built-in Java Data Structures or database (Partial); a Javadoc; Junit test cases.

The 248 class offered a broad range of topics to learn from, and I believe I have taken advantage of most of the principles and topics taught. we look forward to tweaking this project further, and even putting it on the Google Play Store as a small minigame of sorts or a ccomplete webapp for Parking Garage System, make it international, we thing of still working on it add more features, make the app very useful and able to help in the future.
